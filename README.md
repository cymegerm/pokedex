# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## General considerations

Yarn is used as the package manager on this project. If you are more familiar with npm you can consult [npm yarn migration
](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)
Actual version is 1.22.5 and you can upgrade with this command: `curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash`

Please set `git config core.autocrlf false` if you work on Windows, so we won't mess with End of line characters.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
 any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag
 for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Jest is used as the test runner on this project.

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
You can also watch with `yarn test:watch` if you want hot reload on tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Cypress is used as the test runner on this project.

Run `` (TODO: Add script names) to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress
/issues/3207) when IE and Safari are supported.
